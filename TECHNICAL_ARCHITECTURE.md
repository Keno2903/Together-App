# Together App: Technical Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture for the Together App, covering the frontend, backend, and infrastructure.

## 1. Frontend

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo. This allows for rapid development and cross-platform parity between iOS and Android from a single codebase.
- **Language:** TypeScript. We use TypeScript for static typing to improve code quality, catch errors early, and enhance developer experience.
- **Navigation:** Expo Router. Provides a file-based routing system that is intuitive and integrates well with the Expo ecosystem.
- **State Management:** React Context and Hooks are used for managing local and global state. For more complex state, we may consider libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit in the future.
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, and Husky are configured to enforce a consistent code style and prevent errors from being committed.

## 2. Backend (Planned)

- **Framework:** Node.js with NestJS. NestJS provides a robust, scalable, and well-structured framework for building our backend services.
- **Language:** TypeScript. Using TypeScript on both the frontend and backend creates consistency across the stack.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL. A powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability and performance.
- **ORM:** Prisma. A next-generation ORM that makes database access easy with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We will implement a custom JWT-based authentication system to manage user sessions securely.

## 3. Infrastructure (Planned)

- **Hosting:** Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services that can scale with our application's needs.
- **Media Storage:** AWS S3. All user-uploaded media (images, audio files) will be stored securely and efficiently in S3 buckets.
- **Containerization:** Docker. We will use Docker to containerize our backend services, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions. A continuous integration and deployment pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployments.
